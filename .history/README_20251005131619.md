# How to use

To use the scripts, you need to install the cryptography library.

```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install click
pip install numpy
```

Then, you can run the scripts by executing the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

Replace `script.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
