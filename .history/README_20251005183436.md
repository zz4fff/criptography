# In this repository

The algorithms are divided into two categories: classic and symmetric. The classic algorithms are based on the Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher, and other simple substitution ciphers. The symmetric algorithms, such as DES and AES, are used for encryption and decryption of data.

## Classic Encryption Algorithms

- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- ROT13 Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Simple Substitution Cipher
- Polialphabetic Substitution Cipher
- Transposition Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Atbash Cipher
- Affine Cipher

## Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Triple DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Blowfish
- Twofish
- RC4, RC5, RC6, RC7
- ChaCha20, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Salsa20, XSalsa20
- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (ex.: Kyber, Dilithium)

# How to use

To use the scripts, you need a virtual environment with Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can create a virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages by running the following commands:  

```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install click
pip install numpy
```
Then, you can run the scripts by executing the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

Replace `script.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
