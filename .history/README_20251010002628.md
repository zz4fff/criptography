# In this repository

The algorithms are divided into two categories: classic and symmetric. The classic algorithms are based on the Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher, and other simple substitution ciphers. The symmetric algorithms, such as DES and AES, are used for encryption and decryption of data.

The scripts in this repository demonstrate the use of the cryptography library in Python. The library provides a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including classic and symmetric encryption algorithms, as well as post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

The scripts are organized in separate codes for each algorithm. Each code includes a brief description of the algorithm, a demonstration of how to use the algorithm, and a comparison of the output with the expected output. Because the scripts are designed to demonstrate the use of the cryptography library in Python, they may not be suitable for all users. It is recommended to review the code and understand the logic before using it. The code is intended to be used as a reference for understanding the cryptography library in Python and may not be optimized for performance. Its use is for educational purposes only for my classes of Information Security discipline in the IFSe.

# How to use

To use the scripts, you need a virtual environment with Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can create a virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages by running the following commands:  

```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install click
pip install numpy
```
Then, you can run the scripts by executing the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

Replace `script.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
